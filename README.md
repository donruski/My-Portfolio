## About Me

Hello! I'm Jamogha Orugba Lucky, a results-driven Software Quality Assurance Engineer with over three years of hands-on experience testing web and mobile applications across different industries. I specialize in both manual and automated testing, with a strong focus on delivering reliable, high-quality products through detailed test case development, bug tracking, regression testing, and API validation.

Over the years, I have worked closely with developers, designers, and product teams to identify issues early in the development lifecycle, reduce production bugs, and improve overall user experience. I have led QA efforts for multiple major releases, executed thousands of test cases, and contributed to improved delivery timelines and software performance. My experience includes API testing using Postman and JMeter, web automation with Selenium and Playwright, and effective test management using tools like Jira and Trello.

In addition to my QA background, I have experience as a freelance QA tester and WordPress developer, where I delivered and maintained client projects end-to-end, ensuring cross-browser compatibility, responsiveness, and performance optimization. I am detail-oriented, highly collaborative, and passionate about continuous learning and improving testing processes. I thrive in remote environments and take pride in being dependable, proactive, and quality-focused in every project I work on.
